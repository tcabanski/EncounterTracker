    "Description": "An assassin vine is an ambulatory plant that collects its fertilizer by grabbing and crushing prey and depositing the carcasses near its roots. It usually stays put unless it needs to seek out prey. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch from the main vine every 6 inches. In late summer, the secondary vines produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor.\n\nA subterranean variant grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of heat. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/33010-assassin-vine)",

They race in pursuit of their prey, running it down until it’s too exhausted to fight back. Only the threat of dawn drives the pack back into hiding.\n\nA pack of yeth hounds can be created by powerful Fey such as the Queen of Air and Darkness. Each pack’s master can telepathically communicate with their yeth hounds to give the pack commands from afar. If a pack’s master is killed, the hounds seek out a new master, typically an evil vampire, necromancer, or hag.\n\nA yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Its head has a human-like face and glowing red eyes. The creature gives off a smoky odor.\n\nYeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that causes most creatures to flee in terror. They chase those who run and torment them before closing in for the kill. Those that fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through yeth hounds as if they were made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.\n\nYeth hounds can’t stand sunlight. A pack hunts at night and seeks to return to its dark den before dawn. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, and its master can retrieve it only after sunset.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560968-yeth-hound)",

If a pack’s master is killed, the hounds seek out a new master, typically an evil vampire, necromancer, or hag.\n\nA yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Its head has a human-like face and glowing red eyes. The creature gives off a smoky odor.\n\nYeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that causes most creatures to flee in terror. They chase those who run and torment them before closing in for the kill. Those that fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through yeth hounds as if they were made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.\n\nYeth hounds can’t stand sunlight. A pack hunts at night and seeks to return to its dark den before dawn. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, and its master can retrieve it only after sunset.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560968-yeth-hound)",

They are aggressive and hardy warriors, taking severe measures to ward strangers away from their homes. Interlopers that come too close have their moral character judged, then are put to sleep or frightened off.\n\nForest Protectors. Sprites build little villages in the boughs of trees and willing treants, in verdant glades brightened by moss, wild flowers, and toadstools. Wild nature thrives, and the sprites allow no trespassers. When intruders are spotted, the sprites lead them astray with ominous rustling from the bushes and distant snapping twigs. Creatures foolish enough to persist in intruding on a sprite’s territory are stung with poisoned arrows and lulled into a senseless sleep. While they slumber, the sprites make good their escape, retreating to an even more secluded area of the forest.\n\nHeart Seers. Sprites can sense whether a creature is good or evil by the sound and feeling of its beating heart. Weighing the balance of a creature’s past actions, a sprite can tell whether its heart beats rapidly in love or flags in sorrow, or whether it is darkened by hate or greed. The sprite’s power to perceive the heart always shows the truth, because the heart can’t lie.\n\nPoison Brewers. In their forest domains, sprites brew toxins, unguents, antidotes, and poisons, including the sleep poison with which they coat their arrows. They venture far into the woods to harvest rare flowers, mosses, and fungi, sometimes crossing dangerous territory to do so. If desperate, sprites even steal their ingredients from the gardens of hags.\n\nGood-Hearted. Because they are judges of the heart and favor good creatures, sprites oppose the will of evil fey and pledge to thwart evil archfey at every turn. If they encounter adventurers on a quest to rid their forest of an evil fey creature or goblinoid menace, they will pledge their support and even come to their aid when the adventurers least expect it.\n\nUnlike pixies, sprites rarely indulge in frivolous merriment and fun. They are firm warriors, protectors, and judges, and their stern bent causes other fey to consider them overly dour and serious. However, fey that respect the sprites’ territory find them staunch allies in times of trouble.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17020-sprite)",

    "Description": "Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.\n\nA wererat clan operates much like a thieves’ guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan’s control are quickly hunted down and killed.\n\nWererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.\n\nOne of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.\n\nEvil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.\n\nCurse of Lycanthropy. A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A remove curse spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.\n\nA lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form — or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.\n\nSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.\n\nPLAYER CHARACTERS AS LYCANTHROPES\n\nA character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope’s speeds in nonhumanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don’t involve equipment. The character is proficient with the lycanthrope’s natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope’s statistics. The character can’t speak while in animal form.\n\nA non-lycanthrope humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope’s proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope’s Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.\n\nThe following information applies to specific lycanthropes.\n\nWererat. The character gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character’s Strength and Dexterity.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17055-wererat)",

The most likely spots for encountering sword wraiths are scenes of ancient ambushes, battlefields where soldiers were felled by magic with no chance to fight back, and sites where enemies were hemmed in and slaughtered without quarter.\n\nHonor Above All. Sword wraiths fly into a rage if anyone questions their valor. Conversely, they are easily appeased by praise. Little pleases them more than hearing a ballad performed in their honor. Towns located near ancient battlefields hold annual festivals of remembrance to keep sword wraiths there placated.\n\nUndead Nature. A sword wraith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/94600-sword-wraith-commander)",

This same solution carries a paralytic enzyme that renders the victim helpless long enough for the hellwasp to grab its prey and flee.\n\nHellwasps thrive in hot weather, but extreme cold causes their shells to crack and their metabolisms to shut down. Consequently, they avoid the icy layers of the Nine Hells (Stygia and Cania).\n\nNests. Hellwasps spew a golden bile similar to amber, which they use to craft enormous nests riddled with chambers and passages. The hellwasps use these nests as communal shelters and food storage. A typical nest is large enough to support a commune of 1d10 + 10 hellwasps, with each hellwasp having an equal voice and role in the society.\n\nHellwasp Telepathy.

The soul of Osvaldo, their eldest son, was taken immediately, and he was transformed into a chain devil. The souls of the younger twins, Terenzio and Elzerina, will be taken when they turn nine years old.\n\nA provision in the contract allows the Cassalanters to buy their way out of it, but doing so requires a tremendous amount of coin and a mass sacrifice of unfortunate people. While Victoro hunts for Dagult Neverember’s lost cache of gold, Ammalia makes plans to host a poisoned feast in celebration of Founders’ Day.\n\nAmmalia is well mannered, well read, well traveled, and exceptionally shrewd. She is known for driving a hard bargain. Her hobby is lepidopterology, and her estate has the most beautiful butterfly garden.

    "Description": "The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.\n\nMost duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.\n\nSlaves to Slavers. The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.\n\nDuergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.\n\nTough as Stone. Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar’s mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.\n\nBorn of Darkness. The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can’t fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the darkness.\n\nEons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar’s vision is compromised by sunlight.\n\nInfernal Master. Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16850-duergar)",

In vengeance, the General of Gehenna created the soul-devouring barghests to devour goblinoid souls.\n\nThe mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume souls. It eats these souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills, preferring goblinoids.\n\nA barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn’t kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying on the occasional lone goblin when the opportunity arises, until they reach adulthood and are capable of seeking out stronger prey. A barghest avoids contact with large, open fires.\n\nAny conflagration larger than its body acts as a gateway to Gehenna and banishes it to that plane, where it is likely to be slain or enslaved by a yugoloth for its failure.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560736-barghest)",

    "Description": "The lord of House Cassalanter is a devilishly handsome half-elf who likes coin and power. He and his wife gained both by cutting a deal with Asmodeus — which involved trading away the souls of their three children.\n\nVictoro is a priest of Asmodeus, though his devotion to the Lord of the Nine Hells is a secret known only to his wife and his closest friends. Most Waterdavians know him as a successful banker, philanthropist, and worshiper of Lathander. Some of his business profits go toward feeding and sheltering the poor. But behind this veneer of generosity, Victoro is a self-serving beast.\n\nThe soul of Victoro’s eldest son, Osvaldo, is forever lost and can’t be saved. To allay his guilt, Victoro has forged a plan to win back the souls of his young twins, Terenzio and Elzerina. Under the terms of the contract, their souls will be forfeit on their ninth birthdays, and that day is fast approaching. But Victoro can buy his way out of the obligation by providing, as the contract states, “one shy of a million gold coins and the sacrifice of one shy of a hundred unfortunate souls.”\n\nVictoro is well schooled, suave, slow to anger, and blessed with good health, long life, and immunity to disease. He dresses in the latest fashions and walks with a ruby-tipped cane, though not because he needs to. This cane has the magical properties of a rod of rulership.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149477-victoro-cassalanter)",

    "Description": "In hobgoblin society, the Academy of Devastation identifies hobgoblins with a talent for magic and puts them through a grueling training regimen that endows them with the ability to call down fireballs and other destructive magic on the host’s behalf. A hobgoblin devastator on the battlefield is simultaneously a boon to all its allies and a threat to every foe around it.\n\nInto the Fray. While other cultures treat their wizards as cloistered academics, hobgoblins expect their spellcasters to fight. Devastators learn the basics of weapon use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies defeated though their magic.\n\nDevastators have the respect of other members of the host, and they receive obedience and deference from many quarters. Their ability to lay waste to entire formations with a single use of magic allows them to gain far more glory in battle than a single warrior.\n\nOther cultures might view the use of such abilities as a short cut to glory, but to hobgoblins a gift for magic is as valued and useful as a strong sword arm or brilliance in tactics. They are all boons from Maglubiyet that must be cultivated and unleashed upon the enemy.\n\nOnly Results Matter. Devastators study a simplified form of evocation magic. Their training lacks the theory and context that other folk study, making them skilled in battle but relatively illiterate on the finer points of how and why their magic works.\n\nThe Academy of Devastation believes that an academic approach to magic is a sign of weakness and inefficiency. A warrior doesn’t need to know about metallurgy to wield a blade, so why should a wizard care about where magic comes from? Devastators love to prove their superiority in battle by seeking out enemy spellcasters and destroying them.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17273-hobgoblin-devastator)",

    "Description": "Wizards and other spellcasters create shield guardians for protection. A shield guardian treads beside its master, absorbing damage to keep its master alive as long as possible.\n\nMaster’s Amulet. Every shield guardian has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed, the shield guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. A shield guardian’s amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn’t being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.\n\nA shield guardian’s solitary focus is to protect the amulet’s wearer. The amulet’s wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.\n\nA spellcaster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been rendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its shield guardian unleashes potent magical power.\n\nMagnificent Treasure. Because a shield guardian’s ownership can be transferred by giving its matching amulet to another creature, some wizards collect exorbitant sums from princes, nobles, and crime lords to create shield guardians for them. At the same time, a shield guardian makes a mighty prize for anyone who slays its master and claims its amulet.\n\nConstruct Nature. A shield guardian doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17012-shield-guardian)",

    "Description": "Younger than Skabatha and older than Endelyn, Bavlorna is called Slack-jawed Lorna because her wide mouth is prone to hang agape. Flies flit in and out of it. She is the hag of the present, the here and now, the moment to moment. Those desperate individuals who seek her out do so to find a remedy for a nagging problem or anxiety. Though she despises unannounced visitors, a tragic tale of woe and misery puts her in a bargaining mood. If these visitors enter into an agreement with Bavlorna, she’ll use her powers to resolve their pressing problem in exchange for something of use to her.\n\nAlignment. Neutral evil.\n\nPersonality Trait. “I detest chores and would rather have other creatures do them for me.”\n\nIdeal. “I don’t care about the past or the future. I live in the present. What I do now, this very moment, is all that matters.”\n\nBond. “I’m safe in my cottage. Why should I leave it when I can make others come to me?\"\n\nFlaw. “Watching someone run widdershins makes me sneeze uncontrollably.”\n\nBavlorna’s Appearance\n\nBavlorna has a toad-like face with a mouth that magically widens and elongates, enabling her to swallow creatures whole. Her bulging eyes move independently, constantly scanning her surroundings. Stained and moldering patchwork garments hide much of the leathery, mummified flesh that stretches over Bavlorna’s compact frame and extraordinarily long, spindly limbs. She must submerge herself in a briny concoction for an hour each day, or her body will dry out until it locks up in a kind of living rictus, and she remains that way until submerged. As the hours pass between each immersion, her movements become more ponderous and her skin audibly cracks as she moves.\n\nBavlorna lives like a hermit. She is frazzled, impatient, paranoid, and vindictive, lashing out at anyone she thinks is trying to deprive her of the treasures she has tucked away in her cottage. She trusts no one, so she creates tiny duplicates of herself, called lornlings, to serve as her attendants. When she travels away from her lair, she does so on her bobbing lily pad (see appendix A), accompanied by lornlings, which use the quickling stat block in appendix C.\n\nBavlorna’s Weakness\n\nBavlorna is allergic to the sight of creatures running counterclockwise in circles, a motion known as “running widdershins.” Creatures that run widdershins within 10 feet of Bavlorna cause her to lapse into a fit of sneezing. See the stat block for more details.\n\nHourglass Coven\n\nThe Hourglass Coven is a group of three hags, each one bound to an aspect of time: one reflects the past, another reflects the present, and the third reflects the future. These hags are utter wickedness distilled into corporeal forms, driven by a lust for secrets that can be used to manipulate their prey.\n\nSkabatha Nightshade, Bavlorna Blightstraw, and Endelyn Moongrave are daughters of Baba Yaga. The three became wild with jealousy when Iggwilv, Baba Yaga’s adopted daughter, surpassed them in power and carved out a Feywild domain for herself in the guise of an archfey named Zybilna. The hags wormed their way into Iggwilv’s good graces, biding their time until they could wrest the domain from her clutches. They waited until Iggwilv was lured away on an important matter to imbue Iggwilv’s Cauldron with the ability to freeze time. When their sister returned, the hags used this power to trap Iggwilv and her court in temporal stasis. The hags then carved up Iggwilv’s domain, splitting it between them. The sisters couldn’t agree on which of them should keep Iggwilv’s Cauldron, so they left it in Iggwilv’s palace and hired some unscrupulous mercenaries to watch over it.\n\nThe hags loathe each other’s company, but one hag will occasionally visit another to plot against the third sister, creating a vicious circle in which Bavlorna and Endelyn plot against Skabatha, Endelyn and Skabatha conspire against Bavlorna, and Skabatha and Bavlorna bedevil Endelyn. Nothing much ever comes of these petty plots and squabbles, however.\n\nSHARED SPELLS OF THE HOURGLASS COVEN\n\nOn the rare occasions when all three hags of the Hourglass Coven are within 30 feet of one another, any one of them can use an action to cast one of the following spells, requiring no material components (spell save DC 14): detect thoughts, dispel magic, finger of death, glibness, locate creature, mass suggestion.\n\nOnce a spell from this list has been cast, no member of the coven can cast that shared spell again until the next dawn, when the coven regains all of its shared spells.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979771-bavlorna-blightstraw)",

Devastators are spellcasters who call down fireballs and other destructive magic in the defense of the court they serve, whether that court is in the Feywild or the Material Plane. A hobgoblin devastator on the battlefield is a boon to their allies and a threat to every foe around them.\n\nFar from being cloistered academics, hobgoblin devastators are masters of the battlefield. In addition to tactical applications of the magical arts, they learn the basics of weapon use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies defeated though their magic. They have the respect of other members of the host and receive obedience and deference from many quarters.\n\nIn the Feywild, many archfey seek to bolster their armies’ might with the services of hobgoblin devastators.\n\nGOBLINOIDS OF THE FEYWILD\n\nThe goblinoid peoples—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—first appeared in the Feywild millennia ago, and they resided there until the god Maglubiyet conquered them. They then spread throughout the multiverse, with many of them ending up on the worlds of the Material Plane. Most goblinoids encountered on those worlds are members of families that have been away from the Feywild for centuries, and over time, those lineages have become Humanoid. Fey goblinoids, who still bear the magic of the Feywild, are rare on the Material Plane but not unheard of. Hobgoblin devastators are examples of such Fey folk, as are hobgoblin iron shadows and nilbogs.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560846-hobgoblin-devastator)",

    "Description": "The mightiest of the golems, the iron golem is a massive, towering giant wrought of heavy metal. An iron golem’s shape can be worked into any form, though most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, and all can belch clouds of deadly poison.\n\nAn iron golem’s body is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to weapons imbued with magic or the strength of adamantine.\n\nBlind Obedience. When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can’t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently — or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.\n\nA golem can’t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can’t be reasoned with or tricked with words.\n\nConstructed Nature. A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16935-iron-golem)",

    "Description": "In response to the long history of conflict between the yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic ritual that could halt a naga’s resurrection by transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.\n\nNagas\n\nNagas are intelligent serpents that inhabit the ruins of the past, amassing arcane treasures and knowledge.\n\nThe first nagas were created as immortal guardians by a humanoid race long lost to history. When this race died out, the nagas deemed themselves the rightful inheritors of their masters’ treasures and magical lore. Industrious and driven, nagas occasionally venture out from their lairs to track down magic items or rare spellbooks.\n\nNagas never feel the ravages of time or succumb to sickness. Even if it is struck down, a naga’s immortal spirit reforms in a new body in a matter of days, ready to continue its eternal work.\n\nBenevolent Dictators and Brutal Tyrants. A naga rules its domain with absolute authority. Whether it rules with compassion or by terrorizing its subjects, the naga believes itself the master of all other creatures that inhabit its domain.\n\nRivalry. Nagas have a long-standing enmity with the yuan-ti, with each race seeing itself as the epitome of serpentine evolution. Though cooperation between them is rare, nagas and yuan-ti sometimes set aside their differences to work toward common objectives. However, yuan-ti always chafe under a naga’s authority.\n\nImmortal Nature. A naga doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17118-bone-naga)",

He also can pull out a double crossbow (a heavy crossbow with reduced range that fires two bolts at the same target). Still, if he gets involved in a brawl, he prefers fighting with fists or a well-flung tankard.\n\nDurnan doesn’t often venture far from the Yawning Portal, using his employees to run errands for him as needed. If he’s feeling charitable, he might gently discourage likable “nobodies” from venturing into Undermountain, if he thinks they wouldn’t survive. He can also direct adventurers toward tavern regulars who might be able to help them or offer useful information.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149798-durnan)",

    "Description": "Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.\n\nGoblinoids. Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.\n\nMartial Might. A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.\n\nHobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.\n\nMilitary Legions. Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.\n\nAs loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.\n\nStrategic Thinkers. Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.\n\nLegions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.\n\nBeast Trainers. Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.\n\nConquer and Control. Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.\n\nHobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.\n\nHobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.\n\nLegion of Maglubiyet. Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don’t fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17160-hobgoblin-captain)",

    "Description": "Smiler has an unnerving smile — hence his name.\n\nA more apt name for this eladrin would be Smiler the Beguiler, as he’s constantly trying to intoxicate others with his relentless optimism and shocking recklessness. Smiler thinks he can accomplish anything with a positive attitude and some death-defying stunt. Although he admits others might end up getting killed by his actions, he believes he can bend the multiverse to his whims if he tries hard enough. He’s really quite insane.\n\nOne of Smiler’s favorite antics is to use a hallucinatory terrain spell to create a little bit of the Feywild in Avernus: a beautiful woodland glade in which to lose himself for a few hours while he meditates and plots.\n\nThis eladrin adventurer from the Feywild became stranded in Avernus after his companions abandoned him. He has spent the past seventy years roaming Avernus, making deals with fiends to survive. Smiler eventually sold his soul to a pit fiend, who gave him the means to topple a nycaloth warlord named Yarrasto. Smiler took control of the nycaloth’s warband and their infernal war machines. Smiler’s gang came to be known as Smiler’s Defilers, and their ferocity terrified the other warlords of Avernus for a while.\n\nThree of Smiler’s rivals — Bitter Breath, Feonor, and Princeps Kovik — joined forces to wipe out Smiler’s Defilers. Smiler escaped and tears around Avernus on a Devil’s Ride, looking for adventurers willing to help him get revenge on the warlords who ganged up on him. Mad Maggie remains his only ally, though he refuses to join her gang.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/417410-smiler-the-defiler)",

    "Description": "A bulette is a massive predator that terrorizes any lands it inhabits. Also called a “land shark,” it lives only to feed. Irascible and rapacious, bulettes fear no other creature, and they attack with no regard for superior numbers or strength.\n\nUnderground Hunters. Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.\n\nWandering Monster. A bulette ranges across temperate lands, feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across. These creatures dislike dwarf and elf flesh, although they often kill them before realizing what they are. A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.\n\nA bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.\n\nAll creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food — even other predators and bulettes. Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male’s death and consumption.\n\nArcane Creation. Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard’s experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, with infusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16818-bulette)",

They follow the ingrained directives of their creators, as they have done since the dawn of time.\n\nPrimeval Relics. In the primeval ages, aboleths ruled a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bound to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, they created chuuls.\n\nPerfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the aboleths’ command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths’ empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.\n\nTireless Guardians. Chuul still guard the ruins of the ancient aboleth empire. They linger in silent observance of eons-old commands. Rumors and ancient maps sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the reward for their boldness is death.\n\nWhatever riches that the explorers bring with them adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, take their gear, and bury it in secret locales aboleths dictated eons ago.\n\nWaiting Servants. Although the aboleths’ ancient empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that come into contact with aboleths immediately assume their old roles. Such chuuls redirect their compulsions to the service of the aboleths’ sinister purposes.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16824-chuul)",

    "Description": "A gazer is a tiny manifestation of a beholder’s dreams. It resembles the beholder who dreamed it into existence, but its body is only 8 inches wide, and it has only four eyestalks. It follows its creator like a devoted, aggressive puppy, and sometimes small packs of these creatures patrol their master’s lair for vermin to kill and lone creatures to harass.\n\nNuisance Pet. A gazer can’t speak any languages but can approximate mimicking words and sentences in a high-pitched, mocking manner. Beholders find gazers amusing and tolerate their presence like spoiled pets. A gazer can’t be tamed by anyone but its creator, except through the use of magic or by bonding with a spellcaster (see sidebar). Some beholders with wizard minions insist they take a gazer as a familiar because they can see through the eyes of these creatures.\n\nAggressive Vermin-Eater. A wild gazer (one living separately from a beholder) is territorial, eats bugs and small animals, and is known for playing with its food. A lone gazer avoids picking fights with creatures that are Medium or larger, but a pack of them might take on larger prey. A gazer might follow humanoids in its territory, noisily mimicking their speech and generally being a nuisance, until they leave the area, but it flees if confronted by something it can’t kill.\n\nVARIANT: GAZER FAMILIAR\n\nSpellcasters who are interested in unusual familiars find that gazers are eager to serve someone who has magical power, especially those who make a point of bullying and harassing others. The gazer behaves aggressively toward creatures smaller than itself, and it tends to randomly attack house pets, farm animals, and even children in town unless its master is very strict. A gazer serving as a familiar has the following trait.\n\nFamiliar. The gazer can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master, provided that the master is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gazer senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17221-gazer)",

    "Description": "A redcap is a homicidal fey creature born of blood lust. Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret.\n\nBlood Lust Personified. In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.\n\nRedcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.\n\nSteeped in Slaughter. To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.\n\nBloodthirsty Mercenaries. Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be fond in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.\n\nAlso, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature’s murderous handiwork.\n\nIn any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2556141-redcap)",

    "Description": "See Monster Manual Expanded 3 for details of the creature.\n\nThe wretched barrow hag, also known as bruha in other parts  of the Realms, looks like an emaciated crone with mottled, dry  leathery skin stretched tight over her hunched body. Her horrid  head is topped with wild, wiry black and grayish hair. Her hateful eyes look sickly and glazed, and her mouth contains sharp, gnarly  yellow teeth and a long, greenish serpentine tongue. The barrow  hag exudes a disgusting, overpowering stench that reminds of  rotten fish and fruit, sickening those close enough to smell her.  \n\nCorpse Eater. As her name suggests, a barrow hag haunts  barrows, catacombs, cemeteries, graveyards, and battlefields where decaying corpses are plentiful. She typically makes her  lair in a crypt or a network of tunnels underneath where she haunts that is difficult to access. Like a ghoul, she feeds on the  decomposing flesh of humanoid corpses, especially that of young  ones. She particularly relishes sucking the putrid marrow from the bones, slurping it with her prehensile tongue.   Corpse Collector. If the barrow hag is unable to find a corpse to consume, she will resort to stalking people, prioritizing children and solitary targets. In combat, she relies primarily on her ability to paralyze her prey with her grotesque tongue before finishing it off with her sharp claws. The barrow hag is also an accomplished magic-user, but will only use her spells against more formidable  opponents. Once she has slain her prey, she drags its corpse to her lair or in a secluded location where she can bury it in a shallow grave or place it in a large jar or barrel to let it decompose for a few weeks until it is ripe enough for her. The barrow hag typically stores several corpses in varying stages of decay.  Accursed Company. The barrow hag is usually a solitary creature, not wanting to draw attention like a large group can, especially if she has moved in recently to a location near a civilized area, such as a cemetery. However, if she decides she needs help, she can create loyal followers by turning captured humanoids into busos, a type of aswang. These busos become her eyes and ears during the day, providing her with information about the local community and potential prey. The hag also attracts the company of ghouls and ghasts that become subservient to her.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2115763-barrow-hag)",

Their magic responds to their fury and amplifies their fighting ability, helping them move with astonishing quickness and strike with terrible force.\n\nEladrin\n\nEladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. They are related to the elves found on the Material Plane. But while other elves can temper their wild impulses, eladrin are ruled by emotion—and due to their magical nature, they undergo physical changes to match their changes in temperament. Eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and most of them have become Fey creatures as a result—those presented here are of the Fey variety. Some are still Humanoid, however, similar in that respect to their other elven kin. The magic flowing through eladrin responds to their emotional state by transforming them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors and abilities that change with their forms. Some eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, while others run through the emotional spectrum each week.\n\nChangeable Natures\n\nWhenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long rest, they can associate themself with a different season, provided they aren’t incapacitated. When the eladrin makes this change, they use the stat block of the new season rather than their old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in their previous form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting them.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560933-summer-eladrin)",

Although he admits others might end up getting killed by his actions, he believes he can bend the multiverse to his whims if he tries hard enough. He’s really quite insane.\n\nOne of Smiler’s favorite antics is to use a hallucinatory terrain spell to create a little bit of the Feywild in Avernus: a beautiful woodland glade in which to lose himself for a few hours while he meditates and plots.\n\nThis eladrin adventurer from the Feywild became stranded in Avernus after his companions abandoned him. He has spent the past seventy years roaming Avernus, making deals with fiends to survive. Smiler eventually sold his soul to a pit fiend, who gave him the means to topple a nycaloth warlord named Yarrasto. Smiler took control of the nycaloth’s warband and their infernal war machines. Smiler’s gang came to be known as Smiler’s Defilers, and their ferocity terrified the other warlords of Avernus for a while.\n\nThree of Smiler’s rivals — Bitter Breath, Feonor, and Princeps Kovik — joined forces to wipe out Smiler’s Defilers. Smiler escaped and tears around Avernus on a Devil’s Ride, looking for adventurers willing to help him get revenge on the warlords who ganged up on him. Mad Maggie remains his only ally, though he refuses to join her gang.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/417410-smiler-the-defiler)",

Djinn rule floating islands of cloudstuff covered with enormous pavilions, or topped with wondrous buildings, courtyards, fountains, and gardens. Creatures of comfort and ease, djinn enjoy succulent fruits, pungent wines, fine perfumes, and beautiful music.\n\nDjinn are known for their sense of mischief and their favorable attitude toward mortals. Among genies, djinn deal coolly with efreet and marids, whom they view as haughty. They openly despise dao and strike against them with little provocation.\n\nMasters of the Wind. Masters of the air, the djinn ride powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower body transforms into a column of swirling air.\n\nAccepting Servitors. The djinn believe that servitude is a matter of fate, and that no being can contest the hand of fate. As a result, of all the genies, djinn are the ones most amenable to servitude, though they never enjoy it. Djinn treat their slaves more like servants deserving of kindness and protection, and they part with them reluctantly.\n\nA mortal who desires the brief service of a djinni can entreat it with fine gifts, or use flattery to bribe it into compliance. Powerful wizards are able to forgo such niceties, however, if they can summon, bind into service, or imprison a djinni using magic. Long-term service displeases a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. Djinn resent the cruel wizards that have imprisoned their kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instruments throughout the ages. Betrayal, particularly by a mortal whom a djinni trusted, is a vile deed that only deadly vengeance can amend.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16842-djinni)",

    "Description": "Kenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.\n\nFallen Flocks. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.\n\nOnce, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master’s library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.\n\nSpeech in Pantomime. Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.\n\nKenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another’s glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat’s meow might be the secret code for “Prepare to attack!” or “Flee for your lives!”\n\nTheir talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.\n\nThe Wistful Wingless. All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17165-kenku)",

    "Description": "Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz’zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.\n\nThough legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.\n\nBeautiful Corrupters. A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal’s bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim’s dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.\n\nInevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature’s actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim’s dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.\n\nA mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely — some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed — the victim’s soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend’s prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.\n\nThe succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn’t responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won’t bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim’s soul.\n\nDeadly Kiss. The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend’s longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend’s kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.\n\nFiendish Offspring. Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17027-succubus)",

    "Description": "Drow elite warriors defend their houses and their superiors against all enemies, although they specialize in fighting dwarves, gnomes, and elves (including other drow). They frequently raid surface settlements under cover of night, returning to the Underdark with prisoners and spoils in tow before dawn.\n\nElite warriors can be male or female.\n\nChildren of Lolth. The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do.\n\nThe wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.\n\nCreatures of Darkness. The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.\n\nUnderdark Cities. The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.\n\nA drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.\n\nPoison Predilection. Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.\n\nDrow Magic. Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.\n\nArms and Armor. Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.\n\nCutthroat Politics. Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.\n\nDrow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house’s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.\n\nMatriarchal Rule. Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.\n\nIn drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow — either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be priests, nor can they rule a house.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17134-drow-elite-warrior)",

    "Description": "A redcap is a homicidal fey creature born of blood lust. Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret.\n\nBlood Lust Personified. In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.\n\nRedcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.\n\nSteeped in Slaughter. To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.\n\nBloodthirsty Mercenaries. Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be found in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.\n\nAlso, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature’s murderous handiwork.\n\nIn any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17300-redcap)",

    "Description": "Mind flayers, also called illithids, are the scourge of sentient creatures across countless worlds. Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near.\n\nIn eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including the githyanki and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds can conceive.\n\nSince the fall of their empires, illithid collectives on the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark.\n\nPsionic Commanders. Mind flayers possess psionic powers that enable them to control the minds of creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, and ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.\n\nWhen an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid’s thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind flayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.\n\nHive Mind Colonies. Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an elder brain — a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind flayer community. From its pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.\n\nHunger of the Mind. Illithids subsist on the brains of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.\n\nAn illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an intellect devourer.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17104-mind-flayer)",

When an efreeti flies, its lower body transforms into a column of smoke and embers.\n\nHaughty and Cruel. The efreet are deceptive, cunning, and cruel to the point of ruthlessness. They despise being forced into servitude and are relentless in pursuit of vengeance against creatures that have wronged them. Efreet don’t see themselves in this light, naturally, and regard their race as fair and orderly, even as they admit to an enlightened sense of self-interest.\n\nSpiteful Slavers. Efreet view all other creatures as enemies or potential serfs. They raid the Material Plane and the elemental planes for slaves, which they capture and bring back to their homes on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The efreet rule as oppressive tyrants, promoting only the cruelest among their slaves. Those overseers are given whips to help keep the rank-and-file slaves in line.\n\nPlanar Raiders. Most efreet reside on the Elemental Plane of Fire, either in great domed fortresses of black glass and basalt surrounded by churning lakes of fire, or in the fabled City of Brass. Additionally, efreet military outposts thronging with their minions and slaves can be found scattered throughout the planes.\n\nOn the Material Plane, efreet dwell in fiery regions such as volcanoes and the burning expanses of the world’s deserts. Their love of the desert brings them into conflict with the djinn that ride the desert whirlwinds, and with the earthbound dao. Efreet utterly despise marids, with whom they have maintained a passionate conflict throughout the history of both races.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16854-efreeti)",

          "Description": "Survivors of the ancient aboleth empire, chuuls are crustaceans the aboleths modified and endowed with sentience. They follow the ingrained directives of their creators, as they have done since the dawn of time.\n\nPrimeval Relics. In the primeval ages, aboleths ruled a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bound to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, they created chuuls.\n\nPerfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the aboleths’ command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths’ empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.\n\nTireless Guardians. Chuul still guard the ruins of the ancient aboleth empire. They linger in silent observance of eons-old commands. Rumors and ancient maps sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the reward for their boldness is death.\n\nWhatever riches that the explorers bring with them adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, take their gear, and bury it in secret locales aboleths dictated eons ago.\n\nWaiting Servants. Although the aboleths’ ancient empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that come into contact with aboleths immediately assume their old roles. Such chuuls redirect their compulsions to the service of the aboleths’ sinister purposes.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16824-chuul)",

          "Description": "An assassin vine is an ambulatory plant that collects its fertilizer by grabbing and crushing prey and depositing the carcasses near its roots. It usually stays put unless it needs to seek out prey. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long. Smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch from the main vine every 6 inches. In late summer, the secondary vines produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild grapes. The fruit is tough and has a hearty but bitter flavor.\n\nA subterranean variant grows near hot springs, volcanic vents, and other sources of heat. An assassin vine growing underground usually generates enough offal to support a thriving colony of mushrooms and other fungi, which spring up around the plant and help conceal it.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/33010-assassin-vine)",

          "Description": "Spirit nagas live in gloom and spitefulness, constantly plotting vengeance against creatures that have wronged them — or that they believe have wronged them. Lairing in dismal caverns and ruins, they devote their time to developing new spells and enslaving the mortals with which they surround themselves. A spirit naga likes to charm its foes, drawing them close so that it can sink its poisonous fangs into their flesh.\n\nBenevolent Dictators and Brutal Tyrants. A naga rules its domain with absolute authority. Whether it rules with compassion or by terrorizing its subjects, the naga believes itself the master of all other creatures that inhabit its domain.\n\nRivalry. Nagas have a long-standing enmity with the yuan-ti, with each race seeing itself as the epitome of serpentine evolution. Though cooperation between them is rare, nagas and yuan-ti sometimes set aside their differences to work toward common objectives. However, yuan-ti always chafe under a naga’s authority.\n\nImmortal Nature. A naga doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17019-spirit-naga)",

          "Description": "Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz’zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.\n\nThough legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.\n\nBeautiful Corrupters. A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal’s bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim’s dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.\n\nInevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature’s actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim’s dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.\n\nA mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely — some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed — the victim’s soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend’s prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.\n\nThe succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn’t responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won’t bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim’s soul.\n\nDeadly Kiss. The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend’s longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend’s kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.\n\nFiendish Offspring. Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17027-succubus)",

          "Description": "Mind flayers, also called illithids, are the scourge of sentient creatures across countless worlds. Psionic tyrants, slavers, and interdimensional voyagers, they are insidious masterminds that harvest entire races for their own twisted ends. Four tentacles snake from their octopus-like heads, flexing in hungry anticipation when sentient creatures come near.\n\nIn eons past, illithids controlled empires that spanned many worlds. They subjugated and consequently warped whole races of humanoid slaves, including the githyanki and githzerai, the grimlocks, and the kuo-toa. Conjoined by a collective consciousness, the illithids hatch plots as far-reaching and evil as their fathomless minds can conceive.\n\nSince the fall of their empires, illithid collectives on the Material Plane have resided in the Underdark.\n\nPsionic Commanders. Mind flayers possess psionic powers that enable them to control the minds of creatures such as troglodytes, grimlocks, quaggoths, and ogres. Illithids prefer to communicate via telepathy and use their telepathy when issuing commands to their thralls.\n\nWhen an illithid meets strong resistance, it avoids initial combat as it orders its thralls to attack. Like physical extensions of the illithid’s thoughts, these thralls interpose themselves between the mind flayer and its foes, sacrificing their lives so that their master can escape.\n\nHive Mind Colonies. Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts. Most illithids belong to a colony of sibling mind flayers devoted to an elder brain — a massive brain-like being that resides in a briny pool near the center of a mind flayer community. From its pool, an elder brain telepathically dictates its desires to each individual mind flayer within 5 miles of it, for it is able to hold multiple mental conversations at once.\n\nHunger of the Mind. Illithids subsist on the brains of humanoids. The brains provide enzymes, hormones, and psychic energy necessary for their survival. An illithid healthy from a brain-rich diet secretes a thin glaze of mucus that coats its mauve skin.\n\nAn illithid experiences euphoria as it devours the brain of a humanoid, along with its memories, personality, and innermost fears. Mind flayers will sometimes harvest a brain rather than devour it, using it as part of some alien experiment or transforming it into an intellect devourer.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17104-mind-flayer)",

          "Description": "A gazer is a tiny manifestation of a beholder’s dreams. It resembles the beholder who dreamed it into existence, but its body is only 8 inches wide, and it has only four eyestalks. It follows its creator like a devoted, aggressive puppy, and sometimes small packs of these creatures patrol their master’s lair for vermin to kill and lone creatures to harass.\n\nNuisance Pet. A gazer can’t speak any languages but can approximate mimicking words and sentences in a high-pitched, mocking manner. Beholders find gazers amusing and tolerate their presence like spoiled pets. A gazer can’t be tamed by anyone but its creator, except through the use of magic or by bonding with a spellcaster (see sidebar). Some beholders with wizard minions insist they take a gazer as a familiar because they can see through the eyes of these creatures.\n\nAggressive Vermin-Eater. A wild gazer (one living separately from a beholder) is territorial, eats bugs and small animals, and is known for playing with its food. A lone gazer avoids picking fights with creatures that are Medium or larger, but a pack of them might take on larger prey. A gazer might follow humanoids in its territory, noisily mimicking their speech and generally being a nuisance, until they leave the area, but it flees if confronted by something it can’t kill.\n\nVARIANT: GAZER FAMILIAR\n\nSpellcasters who are interested in unusual familiars find that gazers are eager to serve someone who has magical power, especially those who make a point of bullying and harassing others. The gazer behaves aggressively toward creatures smaller than itself, and it tends to randomly attack house pets, farm animals, and even children in town unless its master is very strict. A gazer serving as a familiar has the following trait.\n\nFamiliar. The gazer can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master, provided that the master is at least a 3rd-level spellcaster. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the gazer senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. If its master causes it physical harm, the gazer will end its service as a familiar, breaking the telepathic bond.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17221-gazer)",

Although he looks like a middle-aged man whose best days are behind him, Durnan has a sharp mind and can still swing a sword when he must. He doesn’t like talking about his past, and he won’t reveal anything about his time as an adventurer.\n\nIf Durnan has any living family members, he doesn’t speak of them. He rarely says two words when one will do. He has a dark sense of humor and spares no pity on those who take the risk of entering Undermountain.\n\nHe keeps Grimvault, his magic greatsword, within reach under the bar, and can chop tables in half with it if he so desires. He also can pull out a double crossbow (a heavy crossbow with reduced range that fires two bolts at the same target). Still, if he gets involved in a brawl, he prefers fighting with fists or a well-flung tankard.\n\nDurnan doesn’t often venture far from the Yawning Portal, using his employees to run errands for him as needed. If he’s feeling charitable, he might gently discourage likable “nobodies” from venturing into Undermountain, if he thinks they wouldn’t survive. He can also direct adventurers toward tavern regulars who might be able to help them or offer useful information.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149798-durnan)",

          "Description": "Kenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.\n\nFallen Flocks. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.\n\nOnce, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master’s library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.\n\nSpeech in Pantomime. Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.\n\nKenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another’s glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat’s meow might be the secret code for “Prepare to attack!” or “Flee for your lives!”\n\nTheir talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.\n\nThe Wistful Wingless. All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17165-kenku)",

          "Description": "Kenku are feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds, driven by greed. They can perfectly imitate any sound they hear.\n\nFallen Flocks. Kenku wear ill-fitting cloaks, robes, and rags. These garments cover the soft, sleek feathers of their bodies, shrouding their bare arms and legs. They tread lightly when they walk, on talons made for grasping the branches of trees and seizing prey from the lofty skies. Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.\n\nOnce, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master’s library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.\n\nSpeech in Pantomime. Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.\n\nKenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another’s glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat’s meow might be the secret code for “Prepare to attack!” or “Flee for your lives!”\n\nTheir talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.\n\nThe Wistful Wingless. All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17165-kenku)",

From the darkness, the shadow reaches out to feed on living creatures’ vitality. They can consume any living creature, but they are especially drawn to creatures untainted by evil. A creature that lives a life of goodness and piety consigns its basest impulses and strongest temptations to the darkness where the shadows hunger. As a shadow drains its victim’s strength and physical form, the victim’s shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature’s shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.\n\nIf a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its “parent” to vex or slay. Whether the shadow pursues its living counterpart, the creature that birthed the shadow no longer casts one until the monster is destroyed.\n\nUndead Nature. A shadow doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17010-shadow)",

          "Description": "See Monster Manual Expanded 3 for details of the creature.\n\nThe wretched barrow hag, also known as bruha in other parts  of the Realms, looks like an emaciated crone with mottled, dry  leathery skin stretched tight over her hunched body. Her horrid  head is topped with wild, wiry black and grayish hair. Her hateful eyes look sickly and glazed, and her mouth contains sharp, gnarly  yellow teeth and a long, greenish serpentine tongue. The barrow  hag exudes a disgusting, overpowering stench that reminds of  rotten fish and fruit, sickening those close enough to smell her.  \n\nCorpse Eater. As her name suggests, a barrow hag haunts  barrows, catacombs, cemeteries, graveyards, and battlefields where decaying corpses are plentiful. She typically makes her  lair in a crypt or a network of tunnels underneath where she haunts that is difficult to access. Like a ghoul, she feeds on the  decomposing flesh of humanoid corpses, especially that of young  ones. She particularly relishes sucking the putrid marrow from the bones, slurping it with her prehensile tongue.   Corpse Collector. If the barrow hag is unable to find a corpse to consume, she will resort to stalking people, prioritizing children and solitary targets. In combat, she relies primarily on her ability to paralyze her prey with her grotesque tongue before finishing it off with her sharp claws. The barrow hag is also an accomplished magic-user, but will only use her spells against more formidable  opponents. Once she has slain her prey, she drags its corpse to her lair or in a secluded location where she can bury it in a shallow grave or place it in a large jar or barrel to let it decompose for a few weeks until it is ripe enough for her. The barrow hag typically stores several corpses in varying stages of decay.  Accursed Company. The barrow hag is usually a solitary creature, not wanting to draw attention like a large group can, especially if she has moved in recently to a location near a civilized area, such as a cemetery. However, if she decides she needs help, she can create loyal followers by turning captured humanoids into busos, a type of aswang. These busos become her eyes and ears during the day, providing her with information about the local community and potential prey. The hag also attracts the company of ghouls and ghasts that become subservient to her.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2115763-barrow-hag)",

          "Description": "Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.\n\nA wererat clan operates much like a thieves’ guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan’s control are quickly hunted down and killed.\n\nWererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.\n\nOne of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.\n\nEvil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.\n\nCurse of Lycanthropy. A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A remove curse spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.\n\nA lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form — or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.\n\nSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.\n\nPLAYER CHARACTERS AS LYCANTHROPES\n\nA character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope’s speeds in nonhumanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don’t involve equipment. The character is proficient with the lycanthrope’s natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope’s statistics. The character can’t speak while in animal form.\n\nA non-lycanthrope humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope’s proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope’s Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.\n\nThe following information applies to specific lycanthropes.\n\nWererat. The character gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character’s Strength and Dexterity.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17055-wererat)",

          "Description": "Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities. They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.\n\nA wererat clan operates much like a thieves’ guild, with wererats transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the clan’s control are quickly hunted down and killed.\n\nWererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among wererats.\n\nOne of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red in the dark.\n\nEvil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and towns.\n\nCurse of Lycanthropy. A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes. A remove curse spell can rid an afflicted lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of the curse only with a wish.\n\nA lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises, the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into its beast form — or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation, though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.\n\nSome individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will. Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the weak.\n\nPLAYER CHARACTERS AS LYCANTHROPES\n\nA character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the lycanthrope’s speeds in nonhumanoid form, damage immunities, traits, and actions that don’t involve equipment. The character is proficient with the lycanthrope’s natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope’s statistics. The character can’t speak while in animal form.\n\nA non-lycanthrope humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope’s proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope’s Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.\n\nThe following information applies to specific lycanthropes.\n\nWererat. The character gains a Dexterity of 15 if his or her score isn’t already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character’s Strength and Dexterity.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17055-wererat)",

          "Description": "Drow elite warriors defend their houses and their superiors against all enemies, although they specialize in fighting dwarves, gnomes, and elves (including other drow). They frequently raid surface settlements under cover of night, returning to the Underdark with prisoners and spoils in tow before dawn.\n\nElite warriors can be male or female.\n\nChildren of Lolth. The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do.\n\nThe wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.\n\nCreatures of Darkness. The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.\n\nUnderdark Cities. The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings.\n\nA drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.\n\nPoison Predilection. Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.\n\nDrow Magic. Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.\n\nArms and Armor. Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.\n\nCutthroat Politics. Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.\n\nDrow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house’s social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.\n\nMatriarchal Rule. Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.\n\nIn drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow — either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be priests, nor can they rule a house.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17134-drow-elite-warrior)",

          "Description": "Younger than Skabatha and older than Endelyn, Bavlorna is called Slack-jawed Lorna because her wide mouth is prone to hang agape. Flies flit in and out of it. She is the hag of the present, the here and now, the moment to moment. Those desperate individuals who seek her out do so to find a remedy for a nagging problem or anxiety. Though she despises unannounced visitors, a tragic tale of woe and misery puts her in a bargaining mood. If these visitors enter into an agreement with Bavlorna, she’ll use her powers to resolve their pressing problem in exchange for something of use to her.\n\nAlignment. Neutral evil.\n\nPersonality Trait. “I detest chores and would rather have other creatures do them for me.”\n\nIdeal. “I don’t care about the past or the future. I live in the present. What I do now, this very moment, is all that matters.”\n\nBond. “I’m safe in my cottage. Why should I leave it when I can make others come to me?\"\n\nFlaw. “Watching someone run widdershins makes me sneeze uncontrollably.”\n\nBavlorna’s Appearance\n\nBavlorna has a toad-like face with a mouth that magically widens and elongates, enabling her to swallow creatures whole. Her bulging eyes move independently, constantly scanning her surroundings. Stained and moldering patchwork garments hide much of the leathery, mummified flesh that stretches over Bavlorna’s compact frame and extraordinarily long, spindly limbs. She must submerge herself in a briny concoction for an hour each day, or her body will dry out until it locks up in a kind of living rictus, and she remains that way until submerged. As the hours pass between each immersion, her movements become more ponderous and her skin audibly cracks as she moves.\n\nBavlorna lives like a hermit. She is frazzled, impatient, paranoid, and vindictive, lashing out at anyone she thinks is trying to deprive her of the treasures she has tucked away in her cottage. She trusts no one, so she creates tiny duplicates of herself, called lornlings, to serve as her attendants. When she travels away from her lair, she does so on her bobbing lily pad (see appendix A), accompanied by lornlings, which use the quickling stat block in appendix C.\n\nBavlorna’s Weakness\n\nBavlorna is allergic to the sight of creatures running counterclockwise in circles, a motion known as “running widdershins.” Creatures that run widdershins within 10 feet of Bavlorna cause her to lapse into a fit of sneezing. See the stat block for more details.\n\nHourglass Coven\n\nThe Hourglass Coven is a group of three hags, each one bound to an aspect of time: one reflects the past, another reflects the present, and the third reflects the future. These hags are utter wickedness distilled into corporeal forms, driven by a lust for secrets that can be used to manipulate their prey.\n\nSkabatha Nightshade, Bavlorna Blightstraw, and Endelyn Moongrave are daughters of Baba Yaga. The three became wild with jealousy when Iggwilv, Baba Yaga’s adopted daughter, surpassed them in power and carved out a Feywild domain for herself in the guise of an archfey named Zybilna. The hags wormed their way into Iggwilv’s good graces, biding their time until they could wrest the domain from her clutches. They waited until Iggwilv was lured away on an important matter to imbue Iggwilv’s Cauldron with the ability to freeze time. When their sister returned, the hags used this power to trap Iggwilv and her court in temporal stasis. The hags then carved up Iggwilv’s domain, splitting it between them. The sisters couldn’t agree on which of them should keep Iggwilv’s Cauldron, so they left it in Iggwilv’s palace and hired some unscrupulous mercenaries to watch over it.\n\nThe hags loathe each other’s company, but one hag will occasionally visit another to plot against the third sister, creating a vicious circle in which Bavlorna and Endelyn plot against Skabatha, Endelyn and Skabatha conspire against Bavlorna, and Skabatha and Bavlorna bedevil Endelyn. Nothing much ever comes of these petty plots and squabbles, however.\n\nSHARED SPELLS OF THE HOURGLASS COVEN\n\nOn the rare occasions when all three hags of the Hourglass Coven are within 30 feet of one another, any one of them can use an action to cast one of the following spells, requiring no material components (spell save DC 14): detect thoughts, dispel magic, finger of death, glibness, locate creature, mass suggestion.\n\nOnce a spell from this list has been cast, no member of the coven can cast that shared spell again until the next dawn, when the coven regains all of its shared spells.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979771-bavlorna-blightstraw)",

A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon’s draconic nature by offering it “treasure” in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.\n\nThe Colors of Age. A faerie dragon’s scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.\n\n\n\nDragon Color\n\nAge Range\n\n\n\n\nRed\n\n5 years or less\n\n\nOrange\n\n6–10 years\n\n\nYellow\n\n11–20 years\n\n\nGreen\n\n21–30 years\n\n\nBlue\n\n31–40 years\n\n\nIndigo\n\n41–50 years\n\n\nViolet\n\n51 years or more\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17107-faerie-dragon-younger)",

          "Description": "The lord of House Cassalanter is a devilishly handsome half-elf who likes coin and power. He and his wife gained both by cutting a deal with Asmodeus — which involved trading away the souls of their three children.\n\nVictoro is a priest of Asmodeus, though his devotion to the Lord of the Nine Hells is a secret known only to his wife and his closest friends. Most Waterdavians know him as a successful banker, philanthropist, and worshiper of Lathander. Some of his business profits go toward feeding and sheltering the poor. But behind this veneer of generosity, Victoro is a self-serving beast.\n\nThe soul of Victoro’s eldest son, Osvaldo, is forever lost and can’t be saved. To allay his guilt, Victoro has forged a plan to win back the souls of his young twins, Terenzio and Elzerina. Under the terms of the contract, their souls will be forfeit on their ninth birthdays, and that day is fast approaching. But Victoro can buy his way out of the obligation by providing, as the contract states, “one shy of a million gold coins and the sacrifice of one shy of a hundred unfortunate souls.”\n\nVictoro is well schooled, suave, slow to anger, and blessed with good health, long life, and immunity to disease. He dresses in the latest fashions and walks with a ruby-tipped cane, though not because he needs to. This cane has the magical properties of a rod of rulership.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/149477-victoro-cassalanter)",

Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.\n\nBarbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try to flee them.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16800-barbed-devil)",

Transformed into creatures called skum, they barely resemble their past forms, their skin turning slimy and translucent while their limbs warp to resemble those of deep-sea oddities. The change makes them dependent on water, which they must immerse themselves in regularly lest they experience painful — and potentially lethal — skin eruptions. Skum are bound to their aboleth master not just by their cursed state, but by a psychic bond that compels them to serve its every sinister whim.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/316647-skum)",

An iron golem’s shape can be worked into any form, though most are fashioned to look like giant suits of armor. Its fist can destroy creatures with a single blow, and its clanging steps shake the earth beneath its feet. Iron golems wield enormous blades to extend their reach, and all can belch clouds of deadly poison.\n\nAn iron golem’s body is smelted with rare tinctures and admixtures. Though other golems bear weaknesses inherent in their materials or the power of the elemental spirit bound within them, iron golems were designed to be nearly invulnerable. Their iron bodies imprison the spirits that drive them, and are susceptible only to weapons imbued with magic or the strength of adamantine.\n\nBlind Obedience. When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can’t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently — or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.\n\nA golem can’t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can’t be reasoned with or tricked with words.\n\nConstructed Nature. A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16935-iron-golem)",

          "Description": "Younger than Skabatha and older than Endelyn, Bavlorna is called Slack-jawed Lorna because her wide mouth is prone to hang agape. Flies flit in and out of it. She is the hag of the present, the here and now, the moment to moment. Those desperate individuals who seek her out do so to find a remedy for a nagging problem or anxiety. Though she despises unannounced visitors, a tragic tale of woe and misery puts her in a bargaining mood. If these visitors enter into an agreement with Bavlorna, she’ll use her powers to resolve their pressing problem in exchange for something of use to her.\n\nAlignment. Neutral evil.\n\nPersonality Trait. “I detest chores and would rather have other creatures do them for me.”\n\nIdeal. “I don’t care about the past or the future. I live in the present. What I do now, this very moment, is all that matters.”\n\nBond. “I’m safe in my cottage. Why should I leave it when I can make others come to me?\"\n\nFlaw. “Watching someone run widdershins makes me sneeze uncontrollably.”\n\nBavlorna’s Appearance\n\nBavlorna has a toad-like face with a mouth that magically widens and elongates, enabling her to swallow creatures whole. Her bulging eyes move independently, constantly scanning her surroundings. Stained and moldering patchwork garments hide much of the leathery, mummified flesh that stretches over Bavlorna’s compact frame and extraordinarily long, spindly limbs. She must submerge herself in a briny concoction for an hour each day, or her body will dry out until it locks up in a kind of living rictus, and she remains that way until submerged. As the hours pass between each immersion, her movements become more ponderous and her skin audibly cracks as she moves.\n\nBavlorna lives like a hermit. She is frazzled, impatient, paranoid, and vindictive, lashing out at anyone she thinks is trying to deprive her of the treasures she has tucked away in her cottage. She trusts no one, so she creates tiny duplicates of herself, called lornlings, to serve as her attendants. When she travels away from her lair, she does so on her bobbing lily pad (see appendix A), accompanied by lornlings, which use the quickling stat block in appendix C.\n\nBavlorna’s Weakness\n\nBavlorna is allergic to the sight of creatures running counterclockwise in circles, a motion known as “running widdershins.” Creatures that run widdershins within 10 feet of Bavlorna cause her to lapse into a fit of sneezing. See the stat block for more details.\n\nHourglass Coven\n\nThe Hourglass Coven is a group of three hags, each one bound to an aspect of time: one reflects the past, another reflects the present, and the third reflects the future. These hags are utter wickedness distilled into corporeal forms, driven by a lust for secrets that can be used to manipulate their prey.\n\nSkabatha Nightshade, Bavlorna Blightstraw, and Endelyn Moongrave are daughters of Baba Yaga. The three became wild with jealousy when Iggwilv, Baba Yaga’s adopted daughter, surpassed them in power and carved out a Feywild domain for herself in the guise of an archfey named Zybilna. The hags wormed their way into Iggwilv’s good graces, biding their time until they could wrest the domain from her clutches. They waited until Iggwilv was lured away on an important matter to imbue Iggwilv’s Cauldron with the ability to freeze time. When their sister returned, the hags used this power to trap Iggwilv and her court in temporal stasis. The hags then carved up Iggwilv’s domain, splitting it between them. The sisters couldn’t agree on which of them should keep Iggwilv’s Cauldron, so they left it in Iggwilv’s palace and hired some unscrupulous mercenaries to watch over it.\n\nThe hags loathe each other’s company, but one hag will occasionally visit another to plot against the third sister, creating a vicious circle in which Bavlorna and Endelyn plot against Skabatha, Endelyn and Skabatha conspire against Bavlorna, and Skabatha and Bavlorna bedevil Endelyn. Nothing much ever comes of these petty plots and squabbles, however.\n\nSHARED SPELLS OF THE HOURGLASS COVEN\n\nOn the rare occasions when all three hags of the Hourglass Coven are within 30 feet of one another, any one of them can use an action to cast one of the following spells, requiring no material components (spell save DC 14): detect thoughts, dispel magic, finger of death, glibness, locate creature, mass suggestion.\n\nOnce a spell from this list has been cast, no member of the coven can cast that shared spell again until the next dawn, when the coven regains all of its shared spells.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979771-bavlorna-blightstraw)",

          "Description": "Anhkoloxes are vicious undead creatures created from the bones of bears and other beasts. Their barbed bones grind and crack, often moving in seemingly impossible ways. Anhkoloxes are driven by territorial instinct and a predatory urge to hunt and devour living prey. They run on all fours and rear up onto their hind legs when they corner their quarry. When they strike, they wallop foes about with their claws—they delight in knocking foes into pits full of jagged bones—and their barbed rib cage cracks open like a hunting trap to snap closed around a victim.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/3081098-anhkolox)",

          "Description": "Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.\n\nGoblinoids. Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.\n\nMartial Might. A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.\n\nHobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.\n\nMilitary Legions. Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.\n\nAs loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.\n\nStrategic Thinkers. Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.\n\nLegions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.\n\nBeast Trainers. Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.\n\nConquer and Control. Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.\n\nHobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.\n\nHobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.\n\nLegion of Maglubiyet. Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don’t fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17160-hobgoblin-captain)",

          "Description": "Hobgoblins with a prodigious talent for magic sometimes undergo grueling training to become hobgoblin devastators. Devastators are spellcasters who call down fireballs and other destructive magic in the defense of the court they serve, whether that court is in the Feywild or the Material Plane. A hobgoblin devastator on the battlefield is a boon to their allies and a threat to every foe around them.\n\nFar from being cloistered academics, hobgoblin devastators are masters of the battlefield. In addition to tactical applications of the magical arts, they learn the basics of weapon use, and they measure their deeds by the enemies defeated though their magic. They have the respect of other members of the host and receive obedience and deference from many quarters.\n\nIn the Feywild, many archfey seek to bolster their armies’ might with the services of hobgoblin devastators.\n\nGOBLINOIDS OF THE FEYWILD\n\nThe goblinoid peoples—goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears—first appeared in the Feywild millennia ago, and they resided there until the god Maglubiyet conquered them. They then spread throughout the multiverse, with many of them ending up on the worlds of the Material Plane. Most goblinoids encountered on those worlds are members of families that have been away from the Feywild for centuries, and over time, those lineages have become Humanoid. Fey goblinoids, who still bear the magic of the Feywild, are rare on the Material Plane but not unheard of. Hobgoblin devastators are examples of such Fey folk, as are hobgoblin iron shadows and nilbogs.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560846-hobgoblin-devastator)",

Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected.\n\nCreatures native to the unicorn’s domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.\n\nWhen a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect.\n\nCurses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.\n\nIf the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17042-unicorn)",

Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret.\n\nBlood Lust Personified.

When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.\n\nRedcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.\n\nSteeped in Slaughter. To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims.

Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be fond in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.\n\nAlso, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature’s murderous handiwork.\n\nIn any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2556141-redcap)",

          "Description": "A redcap is a homicidal fey creature born of blood lust. Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret.\n\nBlood Lust Personified. In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.\n\nRedcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.\n\nSteeped in Slaughter. To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.\n\nBloodthirsty Mercenaries. Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be fond in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.\n\nAlso, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature’s murderous handiwork.\n\nIn any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2556141-redcap)",

          "Description": "A redcap is a homicidal fey creature born of blood lust. Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret.\n\nBlood Lust Personified. In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.\n\nRedcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.\n\nSteeped in Slaughter. To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.\n\nBloodthirsty Mercenaries. Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be fond in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.\n\nAlso, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature’s murderous handiwork.\n\nIn any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2556141-redcap)",

Smiler thinks he can accomplish anything with a positive attitude and some death-defying stunt. Although he admits others might end up getting killed by his actions, he believes he can bend the multiverse to his whims if he tries hard enough. He’s really quite insane.\n\nOne of Smiler’s favorite antics is to use a hallucinatory terrain spell to create a little bit of the Feywild in Avernus: a beautiful woodland glade in which to lose himself for a few hours while he meditates and plots.\n\nThis eladrin adventurer from the Feywild became stranded in Avernus after his companions abandoned him. He has spent the past seventy years roaming Avernus, making deals with fiends to survive. Smiler eventually sold his soul to a pit fiend, who gave him the means to topple a nycaloth warlord named Yarrasto. Smiler took control of the nycaloth’s warband and their infernal war machines. Smiler’s gang came to be known as Smiler’s Defilers, and their ferocity terrified the other warlords of Avernus for a while.\n\nThree of Smiler’s rivals — Bitter Breath, Feonor, and Princeps Kovik — joined forces to wipe out Smiler’s Defilers. Smiler escaped and tears around Avernus on a Devil’s Ride, looking for adventurers willing to help him get revenge on the warlords who ganged up on him. Mad Maggie remains his only ally, though he refuses to join her gang.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/417410-smiler-the-defiler)",

They chase those who run and torment them before closing in for the kill. Those that fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through yeth hounds as if they were made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.\n\nYeth hounds can’t stand sunlight. A pack hunts at night and seeks to return to its dark den before dawn.

Its head has a human-like face and glowing red eyes. The creature gives off a smoky odor.\n\nYeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that causes most creatures to flee in terror. They chase those who run and torment them before closing in for the kill. Those that fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through yeth hounds as if they were made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.\n\nYeth hounds can’t stand sunlight. A pack hunts at night and seeks to return to its dark den before dawn. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, and its master can retrieve it only after sunset.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560968-yeth-hound)",

They chase those who run and torment them before closing in for the kill. Those that fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through yeth hounds as if they were made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.\n\nYeth hounds can’t stand sunlight. A pack hunts at night and seeks to return to its dark den before dawn. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, and its master can retrieve it only after sunset.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560968-yeth-hound)",

You can also use an action to cast the pass without trace spell from the staff without using any charges.\n\n- Tree form: You can use an action to plant one end of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

          "Description": "Long ago, the god Maglubiyet—conqueror and then lord of early goblinoids—bargained with the General of Gehenna for aid. The General provided yugoloths, which then died in service to Maglubiyet. Yet when the time came to honor his part of the compact, Maglubiyet reneged on the deal. In vengeance, the General of Gehenna created the soul-devouring barghests to devour goblinoid souls.\n\nThe mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume souls. It eats these souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills, preferring goblinoids.\n\nA barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn’t kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying on the occasional lone goblin when the opportunity arises, until they reach adulthood and are capable of seeking out stronger prey. A barghest avoids contact with large, open fires.\n\nAny conflagration larger than its body acts as a gateway to Gehenna and banishes it to that plane, where it is likely to be slain or enslaved by a yugoloth for its failure.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560736-barghest)",

          "Description": "Younger than Skabatha and older than Endelyn, Bavlorna is called Slack-jawed Lorna because her wide mouth is prone to hang agape. Flies flit in and out of it. She is the hag of the present, the here and now, the moment to moment. Those desperate individuals who seek her out do so to find a remedy for a nagging problem or anxiety. Though she despises unannounced visitors, a tragic tale of woe and misery puts her in a bargaining mood. If these visitors enter into an agreement with Bavlorna, she’ll use her powers to resolve their pressing problem in exchange for something of use to her.\n\nAlignment. Neutral evil.\n\nPersonality Trait. “I detest chores and would rather have other creatures do them for me.”\n\nIdeal. “I don’t care about the past or the future. I live in the present. What I do now, this very moment, is all that matters.”\n\nBond. “I’m safe in my cottage. Why should I leave it when I can make others come to me?\"\n\nFlaw. “Watching someone run widdershins makes me sneeze uncontrollably.”\n\nBavlorna’s Appearance\n\nBavlorna has a toad-like face with a mouth that magically widens and elongates, enabling her to swallow creatures whole. Her bulging eyes move independently, constantly scanning her surroundings. Stained and moldering patchwork garments hide much of the leathery, mummified flesh that stretches over Bavlorna’s compact frame and extraordinarily long, spindly limbs. She must submerge herself in a briny concoction for an hour each day, or her body will dry out until it locks up in a kind of living rictus, and she remains that way until submerged. As the hours pass between each immersion, her movements become more ponderous and her skin audibly cracks as she moves.\n\nBavlorna lives like a hermit. She is frazzled, impatient, paranoid, and vindictive, lashing out at anyone she thinks is trying to deprive her of the treasures she has tucked away in her cottage. She trusts no one, so she creates tiny duplicates of herself, called lornlings, to serve as her attendants. When she travels away from her lair, she does so on her bobbing lily pad (see appendix A), accompanied by lornlings, which use the quickling stat block in appendix C.\n\nBavlorna’s Weakness\n\nBavlorna is allergic to the sight of creatures running counterclockwise in circles, a motion known as “running widdershins.” Creatures that run widdershins within 10 feet of Bavlorna cause her to lapse into a fit of sneezing. See the stat block for more details.\n\nHourglass Coven\n\nThe Hourglass Coven is a group of three hags, each one bound to an aspect of time: one reflects the past, another reflects the present, and the third reflects the future. These hags are utter wickedness distilled into corporeal forms, driven by a lust for secrets that can be used to manipulate their prey.\n\nSkabatha Nightshade, Bavlorna Blightstraw, and Endelyn Moongrave are daughters of Baba Yaga. The three became wild with jealousy when Iggwilv, Baba Yaga’s adopted daughter, surpassed them in power and carved out a Feywild domain for herself in the guise of an archfey named Zybilna. The hags wormed their way into Iggwilv’s good graces, biding their time until they could wrest the domain from her clutches. They waited until Iggwilv was lured away on an important matter to imbue Iggwilv’s Cauldron with the ability to freeze time. When their sister returned, the hags used this power to trap Iggwilv and her court in temporal stasis. The hags then carved up Iggwilv’s domain, splitting it between them. The sisters couldn’t agree on which of them should keep Iggwilv’s Cauldron, so they left it in Iggwilv’s palace and hired some unscrupulous mercenaries to watch over it.\n\nThe hags loathe each other’s company, but one hag will occasionally visit another to plot against the third sister, creating a vicious circle in which Bavlorna and Endelyn plot against Skabatha, Endelyn and Skabatha conspire against Bavlorna, and Skabatha and Bavlorna bedevil Endelyn. Nothing much ever comes of these petty plots and squabbles, however.\n\nSHARED SPELLS OF THE HOURGLASS COVEN\n\nOn the rare occasions when all three hags of the Hourglass Coven are within 30 feet of one another, any one of them can use an action to cast one of the following spells, requiring no material components (spell save DC 14): detect thoughts, dispel magic, finger of death, glibness, locate creature, mass suggestion.\n\nOnce a spell from this list has been cast, no member of the coven can cast that shared spell again until the next dawn, when the coven regains all of its shared spells.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1979771-bavlorna-blightstraw)",

A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.\n\nNagas\n\nNagas are intelligent serpents that inhabit the ruins of the past, amassing arcane treasures and knowledge.\n\nThe first nagas were created as immortal guardians by a humanoid race long lost to history. When this race died out, the nagas deemed themselves the rightful inheritors of their masters’ treasures and magical lore. Industrious and driven, nagas occasionally venture out from their lairs to track down magic items or rare spellbooks.\n\nNagas never feel the ravages of time or succumb to sickness. Even if it is struck down, a naga’s immortal spirit reforms in a new body in a matter of days, ready to continue its eternal work.\n\nBenevolent Dictators and Brutal Tyrants. A naga rules its domain with absolute authority. Whether it rules with compassion or by terrorizing its subjects, the naga believes itself the master of all other creatures that inhabit its domain.\n\nRivalry. Nagas have a long-standing enmity with the yuan-ti, with each race seeing itself as the epitome of serpentine evolution. Though cooperation between them is rare, nagas and yuan-ti sometimes set aside their differences to work toward common objectives. However, yuan-ti always chafe under a naga’s authority.\n\nImmortal Nature. A naga doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17118-bone-naga)",

          "Description": "In response to the long history of conflict between the yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic ritual that could halt a naga’s resurrection by transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.\n\nNagas\n\nNagas are intelligent serpents that inhabit the ruins of the past, amassing arcane treasures and knowledge.\n\nThe first nagas were created as immortal guardians by a humanoid race long lost to history. When this race died out, the nagas deemed themselves the rightful inheritors of their masters’ treasures and magical lore. Industrious and driven, nagas occasionally venture out from their lairs to track down magic items or rare spellbooks.\n\nNagas never feel the ravages of time or succumb to sickness. Even if it is struck down, a naga’s immortal spirit reforms in a new body in a matter of days, ready to continue its eternal work.\n\nBenevolent Dictators and Brutal Tyrants. A naga rules its domain with absolute authority. Whether it rules with compassion or by terrorizing its subjects, the naga believes itself the master of all other creatures that inhabit its domain.\n\nRivalry. Nagas have a long-standing enmity with the yuan-ti, with each race seeing itself as the epitome of serpentine evolution. Though cooperation between them is rare, nagas and yuan-ti sometimes set aside their differences to work toward common objectives. However, yuan-ti always chafe under a naga’s authority.\n\nImmortal Nature. A naga doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17118-bone-naga)",

The most likely spots for encountering sword wraiths are scenes of ancient ambushes, battlefields where soldiers were felled by magic with no chance to fight back, and sites where enemies were hemmed in and slaughtered without quarter.\n\nHonor Above All. Sword wraiths fly into a rage if anyone questions their valor. Conversely, they are easily appeased by praise. Little pleases them more than hearing a ballad performed in their honor. Towns located near ancient battlefields hold annual festivals of remembrance to keep sword wraiths there placated.\n\nUndead Nature. A sword wraith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/94600-sword-wraith-commander)",

The most likely spots for encountering sword wraiths are scenes of ancient ambushes, battlefields where soldiers were felled by magic with no chance to fight back, and sites where enemies were hemmed in and slaughtered without quarter.\n\nHonor Above All. Sword wraiths fly into a rage if anyone questions their valor. Conversely, they are easily appeased by praise. Little pleases them more than hearing a ballad performed in their honor.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n**Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

          "Description": "A bulette is a massive predator that terrorizes any lands it inhabits. Also called a “land shark,” it lives only to feed. Irascible and rapacious, bulettes fear no other creature, and they attack with no regard for superior numbers or strength.\n\nUnderground Hunters. Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.\n\nWandering Monster. A bulette ranges across temperate lands, feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across. These creatures dislike dwarf and elf flesh, although they often kill them before realizing what they are. A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.\n\nA bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.\n\nAll creatures shun bulettes, which treat anything that moves as food — even other predators and bulettes. Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male’s death and consumption.\n\nArcane Creation. Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard’s experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, with infusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.\n\n[Link to DNDB Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16818-bulette)",
